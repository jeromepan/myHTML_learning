<h2>image formates JPEG:</h2>
<p>whenever you have many diffferent colors in a picture you shoule use a JPEG.</p>

<h2>GIF:</h2>
<p>Use GIF and PNG format when saving images with few colours or large areas of the same colour.
When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as flat colour.
LOGOs, illustrations and diagrams often use flat colours.
<b>NOTE:</b>photographs of snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors, they are not flat colour, they are made up of many subtly different shades of the same colour and are not as suited to
GIF or PNG format.</p>
